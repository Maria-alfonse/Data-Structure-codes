# Data Structure Codes Repository
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure implementations in C and C++. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Contents
The repository is organized into the following directories:
- **AVL**: Implementations of AVL Trees, a type of self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Algorithms**: Various algorithm implementations, potentially including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.
- **BST_TREE**: Binary Search Tree implementations and related operations.
- **BTree**: Implementations of B-Trees, commonly used in databases and file systems.
- **Lists**: Implementations of different types of linked lists, such as singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Postfix**: Code related to postfix expression evaluation and conversion.
- **RedBlack&SkipList&Hashing**: Implementations of Red-Black Trees, Skip Lists, and Hashing techniques.
- **SuffixArray**: Implementation of Suffix Arrays, useful in string processing
